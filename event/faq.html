<h3>10.&nbsp;Why is the exhibition fee for Technology Provider and Service Provider different?</h3>

The exhibition rates for Technology Providers are non-commercial to encourage tech transfer offices, research institutes, enterprises, technology intermediaries, SMEs, startups to participate.<br />
<br />
The higher rates for Service Providers, who are selling products and services, help to defray the cost of organising the event. Nevertheless, the rates are very competitive compared to other events of similar scale and target audience. There is a limited number of booths for Service Provider exhibitors.</p>
<h3>11.&nbsp;Who are Technology Providers?</h3>
<p>Technology Providers make available technologies or intellectual property for technology transfer, commercialisation, licensing, research collaboration, joint development etc. They include tech transfer offices, research institutes, hospitals, enterprises, corporate ventures, technology intermediaries, SMEs, incubators/accelerators, startups.</p>
<h3>12.&nbsp;Who are Service Providers?</h3>
<p>Service Providers sell products and services such as consultancy services, patent agents, database &amp; search services, technology translators, prototyping services, design services etc.</p>
<h3>13.&nbsp;Why do I have to submit a technology offer write-up?</h3>
<p>The technology offer write-up (TechOffer) includes descriptions such as its title, summary, features, specifications, technology readiness level (TRL), applications, benefits and illustrations. The information will be published on the event website and apps for technology seekers know more about your technologies. It also enables IPI and our supporting partners to help you find the right technology seeker to initiate a collaboration.</p>

You may submit the TechOffers online after your application is accepted, and before 31 July 2017. All fields in the TechOffer form are required such as the title, summary, features, specifications, technology readiness level (TRL), applications, benefits and illustrations. The information will be used to assess the suitability of the technology for exhibiting, matchmaking and Crowdpitching purposes.<br />
<h3>15. Does IPI help me to write the TechOffer?</h3>

<h3>16. I am a Service Provider exhibitor. Do I have to submit a TechOffer? Does my booth come with free posters?</h3>
You are not required to submit any TechOffer. You may provide descriptions of your products and services in the corporate profile. The free poster is not applicable to Service Provider exhibitors but you may bring your own posters or marketing collateral. You may also engage the event organiser to produce the posters at your own cost.<br />
<h3>17. Do the Technology Provider booths come with technology posters? What is published in the poster?</h3>
If your TechOffer is submitted and approved before <strong>31 July 2017</strong>, you may choose to have the poster produced by our event organiser free of charge. The A0-sized foam-backed poster will be based on a standard template design with technology title, 250-word summary and an illustration (eg image, diagram, drawing etc). The number of free poster will be dependent on the type of booth you have selected (up to 6 posters for Standard Booth and 1 poster for Small Booth).<br />
<br />
The free poster is applicable to Technology Provider exhibitors using the standard poster template for shell scheme Standard &amp; Small booths only. However, you will bear the cost for additional posters or re-prints after the posters have been produced, and for producing your own-designed posters.<br />
<br />

<h3>18. I am a Technology Provider exhibitor. Can I bring my own technology posters and collateral?</h3>
Yes, you may bring your own A0-sized posters at your own cost. Please ensure that your posters show the same title and summary as shown in the approved TechOffer in our system. You may also bring other marketing collateral eg, standees, pull-up banners, brochures. Please ensure that the collaterals are placed within the space allocated for your booth. Double-sided tape is available from the event organiser to mount the posters onto the booth panels.
<h3>19. Can I bring equipment, prototype and demonstration set to exhibit at the booth?</h3>
<p>Yes, you are strongly encouraged to bring and exhibit them at the booth. Booths with such exhibits attract greater interests from the visitors.

<p>Yes, you may keep them after the event.</p>
<h3>22.&nbsp;What is Crowdpitching and how can I participate?</h3>
<p>Crowdpitching is a platform for Technology Provider exhibitors to present and pitch their technology to the audience for commercialisation or collaboration opportunities. When you submit your TechOffers, you may indicate your interest to participate in crowdpitching. IPI will evaluate the suitability and shortlist the TechOffer for crowdpitching. If accepted, Exhibitors are given 7 minute at the main stage or pitching stage during the crowdpitching sessions. One crowdpitch per Technology Provider exhibitor is accepted.</p>
<h3>23.&nbsp;How many exhibitor passes do I get? Why can&rsquo;t I get more passes?</h3>
<p>For Standard Booth (6-panel), you will get four (4) exhibitor passes. For Small Booth (1-panel), you will get two (2) passes. The exhibitor passes are given to exhibitor personnel who are manning the booth at all times. The exhibitor passes allow exhibitors to access privileged functions in the event system, eg TechOffer submission, meeting and leads management etc so the number of passes is strictly limited.</p>
<h3>24.&nbsp;What are the dates for cancellation and refund policy?</h3>
